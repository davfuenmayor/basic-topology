# Formalising Basic Topology for Computational Logic in Simple Type Theory 
We present a formalisation of basic topology in simple type theory encoded using the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant. In contrast to related formalisation work, which follows more 'traditional' approaches, our work builds upon closure algebras, encoded as Boolean algebras of (characteristic functions of) sets featuring an axiomatised closure operator (cf. seminal work by Kuratowski and McKinsey & Tarski). With this approach we primarily address students of computational logic, for whom we bring a different focus, closer to lattice theory and logic than to set theory or analysis. This approach has allowed us to better leverage the automated tools integrated into Isabelle/HOL (model finder Nitpick and Sledgehammer) to do most of the proof and refutation heavy-lifting, thus allowing for assumption-minimality and less-verbose interactive proofs.
